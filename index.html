    <div>This example shows that the best solution is not always obtained through a<br>
mathematical principle of the equilibrium point type and that it is preferable to<br>
choose a decision where there is A SATISFACTORY AGREEMENT BE-TWEEN THE TWO PARTIES.</div><br>
    <h3>The Social Dilemma Game</h3>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>This game, adapted from Raiffa (2002), is a generalization for N-persons, of<br>
the Prisoners’ Dilemma game, where each participant can take one of two<br>
actions: Cooperate (C) or Not Cooperate (NC). The rules of the game are:</div><br>
    <ul>
        <li> the game is played only once;</li>
        <li> no type of communication is permitted among the players;</li>
        <li> the action (C or NC) taken by each participant is known only to the game<br>
instructor. The instructor communicates to the participants only the total<br>
number of actions C and NC;</li>
        <li>the gains (in dollars) are: each NC players wins $(X = a value that<br>
depends on the number of Cs) and each C players wins $ (Y = number<br>
of Cs less 0.3x N).</li>
    </ul>
    <div>For example, in the case of N = 100 persons, suppose that the number of Cs<br>
is 20. Each of the 20 C players loses $ (20 – 0.3x 100) or $ (-10), paying a<br>
total amount of $200 which will be distributed among the 80 NC players. The<br>
parameter 0.30 can be adjusted by the instructor. The C players generate the<br>
capital to be divided among all.</div><br>
    <div>Now let’s allow reserved communication among the competitors (private<br>
choice) before the game. The number of C or NC will depend on the private<br>
communications. Nevertheless, if the communication is done in an open mode<br>
(public choice), and each player knows who is C or NC, then the number of<br>
C’s should increase.</div><br>
    <div>This game can be illustrated like a problem of birth control among the<br>
population. Each family decides how many children it will put in the world. What<br>
is the perspective for these children to have good quality of life? Should one<br>
family have many children? How about the others families? What is the size of<br>
population that planet Earth can adequately sustain? The game indicates the<br>
need for negotiation among the participants, and that many questions remain<br>
        unanswered.</div>

    <center><h2>Methodologies Used in<br>
Group-Decision-Making</h2></center>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>Organizations make decisions in a group, due mainly to two reasons (Mallach,<br>
2000):</div><br>
    <ul>
    <li> task related reasons: have to do with functional demands and techniques<br>
which make it impossible for a single person to make a decision; and</li>
    <li> organizational reasons: which demand that certain individuals participate<br>
in the decision making process due to the functional, structural and legal<br>
organization of the company.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    <div>Involving lots of people in the decision making process provides a greater basis<br>
of experience, knowledge, and creative insights. It is intuitively reasonable that<br>
the chances of overlooking possible events and possible courses of actions are<br>
diminished in group-decision-making. The synergy of individuals may make the<br>
overall quality of the group decisions greater than the sum of parts. The<br>
creations of juries, panels and cabinets as ways of reaching decisions can be<br>
seen to be based on this promise.</div><br>
    <div>However, if the opinion and values of individuals differ, how should the<br>
differences be resolved? Difference of opinion may inhibit the expression of<br>
critical ideas, resulting in an incomplete survey of alternative courses of action<br>
or choices. Techniques to enhance group’s creative potential and interaction<br>
such as Delphi, SODA (Strategic Options Development and Analysis), and<br>
even the brainstorming process are widely used.</div><br>
    <div>The main difference of a group activity from an individual activity is the<br>
opportunity for interaction among the group members, which enriches the<br>
discussion and the analysis of the problem and provides a more objective<br>
choice of alternatives to resolve the problem. Today, the richness deriving from<br>
interaction can be obtained in various ways, since we have gotten beyond the<br>
phase of meeting around a table or telephone consultations and conventional<br>
mail, and we have the technology of e-mail, audio, and video conferencing.<br>
Consultations, information surveys, mergers, and big business deals can take<br>
place by means of group decisions with no need for the parties to be physically<br>
present at the same place.</div>
    <br><br><br><hr><br><br><br>
    <div>Some of the well-known group-decision methods are: (Warfield, 1976;<br>
Poulton, 1994)</div>
    <ul>
    <li> brainstorming,</li>
     <li> Q-sort method,</li>   
        <li>Delphi method,</li>
        <li>NGT – Nominal Group Technique,</li>
        <li> SODA – Strategic Options Development and Analysis, and</li>
        <li>GDSS – electronic meetings via video conferencing and e-mail using<br>
Work Flow system.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
    <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div><em>Brainstorming</em> is a meeting held to extend the discussion of a given problem<br>
stimulating the creativity and the discovery of new solutions or new directions<br>
to the problem. The informal type of discussion helps greater participation of<br>
the members of the group but a good control of the discussion as well as the<br>
documentation of important facts and results are essential.</div><br>
    <h3>Q-SORT</h3>
        <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>Q-SORT is a group decision process where each participant structures the<br>
decision problem, sorting a set of declarations according to his or her<br>
preference. Each participant receives a set of cards containing the declarations<br>
about the problem. A scaling measure is used to guide the sorting process of<br>
the declarations. The main advantage of this procedure is that it can be repeated<br>
many times using different sorting criteria for the problem.</div><br>
    <h3>Delphi</h3>
        <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
<div>Delphi is known as a methodology useful to generate, clarify, structure, and<br>
organize a set of ideas. The methodology collects and evaluates information or<br>
expert’s opinion with respect to a main subject. It is not allowed for persons<br>
of the group to maintain communication among them. A supervisory team</div>
        <br><br><br><hr><br><br><br>
    <div>selects a group of 30 to 100 experts giving to each expert a questionnaire based<br>
on the most significant answers received, the supervisory team prepares a new<br>
questionnaire to be distributed among the same or a new group of experts. The<br>
process continues until the supervisory team evaluates that a significant and<br>
structured set of answers has been received to solve the problem.<br>
Main characteristics of this method, based on description presented by<br>
Goicoechea et al. (1982), are:</div><br>
    <ul>
    <li> the method can be applied to small or large groups;</li>
    <li> face-to-face contact is not necessary, and in many cases not recom-<br>mended;</li>
    <li> relies on written responses;</li>
    <li> respondents can be at different locations;</li>
    <li> may take more than 6 weeks to complete the decision process;</li>
    <li>group decision is made through aggregation of individual judgments,<br>
usually after three or more rounds of distribution and analysis of question-<br>naires.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>The execution of Delphi is made through the following sequential steps:</div>
    <ol type="1">
    <li> Develop the Delphi question that must be clearly and comprehensively<br>
formulated, reflecting the objective of the problem to be solved.</li>
      <li> Select and contact participants that will be interested in the problem being<br>
examined, and with minimum level of expertise necessary to deal with the<br>
problem.</li>  
        <li>Select a group of respondents among the participants contacted in step<br>
2. Suggested number of the sample group is 30 persons, but it can be more<br>
or less than 30 persons, depending on the problem to be analyzed.</li>
        <li> Develop questionnaire number 1 and test. The purpose of this question-<br>naire is to identify issues. This questionnaire should be tested on a small<br>
sample of persons that are not part of the respondents. After the test, the<br>
questionnaire is sent to the respondents.</li>
        <li> Analysis of the questionnaire number 1. A decision-making staff prepares<br>
a concise list of items identified in the answers of questionnaire 1, and a<br>
summary of comments made by the respondents.</li>
        <li> Develop questionnaire number 2 and test. This questionnaire asks for<br>
comments expressing agreement, disagreement or new questions about<br>
the summary list prepared in Step 5 and sent to the respondents.<br>
Respondents are asked to rank the issues of the list according to the level<br>
of importance.</li>
    <li> Analysis of questionnaire number 2. The staff prepares a summary of the<br>
comments and counts the number of votes according to the rank attributed<br>
to each item of the questionnaire number 2.</li>
    <li> Develop questionnaire number 3 asking to do comments about the votes<br>
received by each item, and give a final vote for the items presented.</li>
    <li> The staff prepares a final report that must contain: the purpose of the<br>
decision, all the intermediate results, and the final decision based on the<br>
aggregation of individual votes collected in step 8.</li> 
    </ol>
   <div>The final report should be discussed and approved by a representative<br>
committee formed by members of respondent groups. For purposes of<br>
feedback and closure, participants should be given a copy of the final report.</div><br><br> 
    <h3>NGT</h3>
            <div class="hl"><hr></div><br>
    <div>NGT-<em>Nominal Group Technique</em> is a technique similar to Delphi, used for<br>
more complex problems to be solved by a small group of persons through face-<br>to-face contact. NGT usually can be done in 1 to 2 hours, whereas Delphi may<br>
take 6 or more weeks to complete.</div><br>
Steps to conduct this technique are:<br><br>
    <ol type="1">
    <li> Leader gives each participant (5 to 9 persons) a written copy of the<br>
question or problem being considered.</li>
    <li> Participants write their own idea or answer to the question or problem<br>
presented.</li>
    <li> The results of group thinking are presented, recording each idea on a flip<br>
chart to avoid duplication. The leader may merge similar ideas forming a<br>
new idea, with the agreement of the group. Discussions are not permitted<br>
during this step.</li> 
    </ol>
